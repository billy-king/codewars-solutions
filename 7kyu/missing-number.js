// You are given an unsorted array containing all the integers from 0 to 100 inclusively. However, one number is missing. Write a function to find and return this number. What are the time and space complexities of your solution?

// My solution

function missingNo(nums) {
    for (let i=0; i<=100; i++) {
      if (!nums.includes(i)) {
       return i;
      }
   }
}
